a quick silly little thing to calculate how much of each pride flag is visible on the xbox pride flag controller (https://unlocked.microsoft.com/pride-gaming/)

very very slow and bad

idk how well it actually works considering it says that the trans flag has 115252 pixels different but there is only 149760 pixels in the image and most of that should be white?? from eyeballing it seems fine lol

anyway results are in results.csv if you dont wanna  wait 20 mins for it to run lol
